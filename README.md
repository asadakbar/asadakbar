## Hi there 👋

Its nice to (virtually and asynchronously) meet you. I'm a full stack engineer that really enjoys pairing my product management background with extensive engineering experience.

⏱️ I'm currently...
  - 👷 **building** Socialmark.io, an app for text based content creators to leverage their social media bookmarks for future content.
  - 🧑‍🏫 **learning** machine learning and ai. I went through DeepAtlas.ai and currently building a couple of ml projects I'll announce soon.
  - 📚 **reading for fun** * *The Bourne Identity* *. Its been on my bookshelf for a while and I enjoy a good action book.
  - 📚 **reading for learning** * *Modern Front-End Development for Rails: Hotwire, Stimulus, Turbo, and React* *
  - 🏋️ **going** to the gym regularly for the first time in my life. I can finally answer in the affirmative when asked "Do you even lift bro?"
